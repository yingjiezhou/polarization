This codes were designed for Lambda polarization study in 3 GeV Au+Au data, and the major analysis maker locates under StRoot/Shift/

step1: update the storage location to your directory, and you only need to change the line 39 and line 40 in script submitByRun_perFile.xml.
 
step2: compile the package
starver SL19e
cons
                  
step3: if you want to test the code locally, just run:
root4star -b -q -l readPicoDst.C
                           
step4: submit jobs in batch, and you can set the starting run number and ending run number in the script submitRunByRun.sh, then
sh submitRunByRun.sh 

NOTE: All the results will be catogried by run under the production directory; You can merge all output files per run by the script haddRunByRun.sh, and then the merged file per run will be saved in directory of production_perRun.
